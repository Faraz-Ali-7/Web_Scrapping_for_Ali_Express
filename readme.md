In order to scrap data from a page, first copy the URL in the r_html_rel.py script and run it, this will save the html of that page in The proj directory.
After this just run the read_html.py to extract the data from the saved HTML and put it into an excel file.

NOTE: IF YOU WANT TO EXTRACT MORE DATA FROM A PRODUCT MAKE CHANGES IN THE read_html.py
